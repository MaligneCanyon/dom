<!--
box4 is clicked:
1. 'target' is the elem that is clicked, i.e. the box4 elem,
fires the click event listener attached to <main id="elem4">
2. 'currenTarget' is the elem that the event is attached to, i.e. elem1,
fires the click event listener attached to <div id="elem1">
(1) fires 1st, then (2), since both events fire in the bubbling phase.


The Solution ...
1.  The click event listener listening on the bubbling phase that alerts the tagName of the target element listening on the div element (the first event handler).
2.  The click event listener listening on the bubbling phase that alerts the tagName of the currentTarget element listening on the div element (the second event handler).

The format of the Solution is to list:
- event type
- phase
- what is alerted
- which Event obj property is ref'd
- which elem the listener is attached to
- placement in the order of event handlers

***

A better format would be to list:
- event type
- which elem the listener is attached to
- phase
- placement in the order of event handlers
- what is alerted
- which Event obj property (if any) is ref'd

1. the 'click' event listener listening on the <div> element in the bubbling phase (the first event handler) alerts "MAIN" (the tagName of the target element)
2. the 'click' event listener listening on the <div> element in the bubbling phase (the second event handler) alerts "DIV" (the tagName of the currentTarget element)
